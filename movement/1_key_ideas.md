1. What is the key idea of the social movement (most important critiques of the current system, central arguments, ideas for alternatives), how did the movement develop historically and what is the idea of societal change?


Software ist heutzutage ein Grundbestandteil von nahezu jedem elektronischen Gerät, was wir nutzen. Die Idee hinter der freien Software Bewegung ist es den Nutzern von Software die Möglichkeit zu geben die Programme zu betreiben, zu überprüfen, zu verändern und schließlich weiter zu geben.
Die freie Software Bewegung tauchte offiziell in den 80er Jahren als Reaktion auf die stetig wachsende Vorreiterrolle proprietärer Software auf. Diese entstanden Ende der 60er Jahre mit den steigenden Produktionskosten aufgrund komplexer werdender Software-Programme.

Proprietäre Software ist für das Umfeld industrieller Konkurrenz ausgerichtet indem sie von Patent-Systemen geschützt wird. Ziel der freien Software ist es im Gegensatz hierzu, jegliche Einschränkung aufzuheben, was die Nutzung und Veränderung der Software betrifft, um Kooperation untereinander zu ermöglichen. Damit soll der technologische Fortschritt mit dem Ziel jedermann im Cyberspace zu befreien (Stallman, 2006) vorangebracht werden.



At this point, an important clarification and distinction between the terms open source and free software should be made. Although often used interchangely and to a large point overlapping, free/libre (libre is often coupled in order to denote the fact that it means free as in freedom of speech, rather than free beer). Open source software licenses may put restrictions on the (re)use of software that are considered not to be free/libre software. 

In order to overcome the debate, the term free/libre open source software has been proposed. Nevertheless, it is the free software movement which appears as strongly politicized and closer to degrowth. As a contributor at the Chaos Communications Congress (the biggest hackers congress in Europe happening yearly in Germany) argued, [the concept of open source was pushed forward in order to include the emerging expansion of free software "into the neo-liberal ideology and the capitalist economy"](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/attachments/967_24c3.HackingIdeologies.OpenSource.a.capitalist.movement.pdf).

The development of the free software movement is historically bound with the vision of a web that provides freedom and agency to its users. This is core to the philosophy of the world wide web conceived by Tim-Berners Lee at the CERN. Up to 1996, the Internet was mostly a place for sharing knowledge and establishing communication, away from commercial interests - its' commercial use was in fact forbidden. But the commercial Internet is nowadays difficult to avoid: Google, Dropbox or Facebook are just a few of the names of the corporations holding and making business out of our data, documents and relationships in the Internet. This delegation of agency (and often ownership) to corporate "data silos" on the cloud  is one of the main threats to the movements' vision of a free web.

At the same time, we are observing the emergence of new patterns of production and consumption of technology. Social-technological innovations, rather than pure technological innovations, seem to be the dominant pattern of innovation. Code development and recombination "factories", such as the famous GitHub, have become social networks for a global sharing of digital production. The *Sharing Economy* brings new forms of relationships between producers and consumers, by establishing a peer-to-peer mode of access to resources.

These developments do not pass without critique from the movement: GitHub is also a centralized commercial platform, and the Sharing Economy has been to a large extent cooptated by the for-profit interests and the controversial model of billion-worth start-ups, such as AirBnb or Uber. This led several organizations standing behind the idea of the *Sharing Economy*, such as OuiShare, to propose the alternate concept of *Collaborative Economy* to distinguish initiatives based on horizontal networks and participation of a community.

At the hardware level, FabLabs, Repair Cafés or Open Source Ecology are sharing their knowledge globally, based on their accumulated experiences while articulating production and learning with their local communities (of practice). Initiatives such as the fairphone or the fair mouse attempt to achieve more ecological and fair means of production - and are revealing of how difficult it is, within the current political ecology of resource extractivism, to actually achieve a fair and ecological production of technological artefacts.
