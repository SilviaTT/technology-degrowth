1. What is the key idea of the social movement (most important critiques of the current system, central arguments, ideas for alternatives), how did the movement develop historically and what is the idea of societal change?


Heutzutage ist Software ein Grundbestandteil in nahezu jedem elektronischen Gerät, was wir nutzen. Die Grundidee der freien Software Bewegung ist den Nutzern von Software die Möglichkeit zu geben, die Programme zu nutzen, zu überprüfen, zu verändern und weiter zu geben.

The free software movement appears officially in the 1980's, as a reaction to the increasing dominance of proprietary software (which started emerging in the late 60s, with the increasing production costs of ever more complex software).

Die freie Software Bewegung trat offiziell in den 80er Jahren hervor als Reaktion auf die stetig wachsende Vorreiterrolle Rolle proprietärer Software, die Ende der späten 60er Jahre mit den steigenden Produktionskosten aufgrund komplexer werdender Software-Programme aufkam.

In contrast to proprietary software, which maps to an industrial competition environment protected by patent systems, the philosophy of free software focuses on removing any restrictions from the use and modifications of software, which are an obstacle to cooperation between peers. It aims in that way at promoting the progress of technology with the goal "to liberate everyone in cyberspace" (Stallman, 2006).

At this point, an important clarification and distinction between the terms open source and free software should be made. Although often used interchangely and to a large point overlapping, free/libre (libre is often coupled in order to denote the fact that it means free as in freedom of speech, rather than free beer). Open source software licenses may put restrictions on the (re)use of software that are considered not to be free/libre software. 

In order to overcome the debate, the term free/libre open source software has been proposed. Nevertheless, it is the free software movement which appears as strongly politicized and closer to degrowth. As a contributor at the Chaos Communications Congress (the biggest hackers congress in Europe happening yearly in Germany) argued, [the concept of open source was pushed forward in order to include the emerging expansion of free software "into the neo-liberal ideology and the capitalist economy"](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/attachments/967_24c3.HackingIdeologies.OpenSource.a.capitalist.movement.pdf).

The development of the free software movement is historically bound with the vision of a web that provides freedom and agency to its users. This is core to the philosophy of the world wide web conceived by Tim-Berners Lee at the CERN. Up to 1996, the Internet was mostly a place for sharing knowledge and establishing communication, away from commercial interests - its' commercial use was in fact forbidden. But the commercial Internet is nowadays difficult to avoid: Google, Dropbox or Facebook are just a few of the names of the corporations holding and making business out of our data, documents and relationships in the Internet. This delegation of agency (and often ownership) to corporate "data silos" on the cloud  is one of the main threats to the movements' vision of a free web.

At the same time, we are observing the emergence of new patterns of production and consumption of technology. Social-technological innovations, rather than pure technological innovations, seem to be the dominant pattern of innovation. Code development and recombination "factories", such as the famous GitHub, have become social networks for a global sharing of digital production. The *Sharing Economy* brings new forms of relationships between producers and consumers, by establishing a peer-to-peer mode of access to resources.

These developments do not pass without critique from the movement: GitHub is also a centralized commercial platform, and the Sharing Economy has been to a large extent cooptated by the for-profit interests and the controversial model of billion-worth start-ups, such as AirBnb or Uber. This led several organizations standing behind the idea of the *Sharing Economy*, such as OuiShare, to propose the alternate concept of *Collaborative Economy* to distinguish initiatives based on horizontal networks and participation of a community.

At the hardware level, FabLabs, Repair Cafés or Open Source Ecology are sharing their knowledge globally, based on their accumulated experiences while articulating production and learning with their local communities (of practice). Initiatives such as the fairphone or the fair mouse attempt to achieve more ecological and fair means of production - and are revealing of how difficult it is, within the current political ecology of resource extractivism, to actually achieve a fair and ecological production of technological artefacts.
